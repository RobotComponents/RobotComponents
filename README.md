Robot Components is a plugin for intuitive robot programming for ABB robots inside Rhinoceros Grasshopper. Robot Components offers a wide set of tools to create toolpaths, simulate robotic motion and generate RAPID code within Grasshopper. Some of the main features include:

- 40+ predefined ABB robot models
- Possibility to add your own robot models
- Support for external axes (both linear and rotational)
- Possibility to define custom strategies for all external axis values
- Support for work objects (including movable work objects)
- Efficient forward and inverse kinematics
- Possibility to add your own custom code lines
- Real-time connection with IRC5 and OmniCore controllers
- [Robot Components API](https://robotcomponents.github.io/RobotComponents-API-Documentation/index.html) to develop your custom components using either Python or C#

## Getting Started
If you use Rhino 7 or higher you can install Robot Components via the package manager. For other versions, you can download the latest release directly from this repository's [releases page](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/releases) or [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/robot-components). Unzip the downloaded archive and copy all files in the Grasshopper Components folder (in GH, File > Special Folders > Components Folder). Make sure that all the files are unblocked (right-click on the file and select Properties from the menu. Click Unblock on the General tab). Restart Rhino and you are ready to go! 

In case you want to use the components from the Controller Utility section you additionally have to install [Robot Studio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio) or the ABB Robot Communication Runtime (you can download it by clicking [here](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/raw/main/Utility/ABB%20Communication%20Runtime/ABB%20Robot%20Communication%20Runtime%202024.1.zip)). The latest release is built and tested against the ABB PC SDK version 2024.1 (ABB Robot Communication Runtime 2024.1). We do not guarantee that the Controller Utility components work with older versions of the ABB Robot Communication Runtime. Besides that, the components from the Controller Utility section are only supported on Windows operating systems. Please contact us if you have problems with establishing a real-time connection from Grasshopper.

You can find a collection of example files demonstrating the main features of Robot Components in this repository in the folder [Example Files](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/tree/master/ExampleFiles). You can find the Grasshopper documentation website [here](https://robotcomponents.github.io/RobotComponents-Documentation/). The documentation website of the API [here](https://robotcomponents.github.io/RobotComponents-API-Documentation/index.html).

For easy sharing of the download link and the documentation (with e.g. students) you can also use our [linktree](https://linktr.ee/RobotComponents).

Robot Components is an open-source project that was initiated by the chair of [Experimental and Digital Design and Construction of the University of Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb06/institute/architektur/fachgebiete/experimentelles-und-digitales-entwerfen-und-konstruieren/home). The plugin is currently further developed and maintained by [Arjen Deetman](http://www.arjendeetman.nl). All developers and contributors are listed [here](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/blob/master/AUTHORS.md).

Robot Components uses the ABB PC SDK for real-time connection to ABB Robots, you can find the SDK used in this project [here](https://developercenter.robotstudio.com/pc-sdk).

Robot Components uses the OPW kinematics solver as described in the paper ['_An Analytical Solution of the Inverse Kinematics Problem of Industrial Serial Manipulators with an Ortho-parallel Basis and a Spherical Wrist_'](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264212870_An_Analytical_Solution_of_the_Inverse_Kinematics_Problem_of_Industrial_Serial_Manipulators_with_an_Ortho-parallel_Basis_and_a_Spherical_Wrist) by Mathias BrandstÃ¶tter, Arthur Angerer, and Michael Hofbaur.

Robot Components uses the inverse kinematics solver ikfast developed by Rosen Diankov as described in his thesis '_Automated Construction of Robotic Manipulation Programs_'.

We would like to acknowledge [Jose Luis Garcia del Castillo](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo) and [Vicente Soler](https://github.com/visose) for making their Grasshopper plugins [RobotExMachina](https://github.com/RobotExMachina) and [Robots](https://github.com/visose/Robots) available. Even our approach is different it was helpful for us to see how you implemented certain functionalities and approached certain issues. 

## Known Issues
Known issues are listed [here](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/issues). If you find a bug, please help us solve it by filing a [report](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/issues/new).

**Adding support for other brands**: Robot Components is developed to intuitively program ABB robots inside Grasshopper. At the moment we have no plans to implement the support for other robot brands. However, we have a few ideas about how to implement this and since we want to keep Robot Components as intuitive as possible we kindly ask you to contact one of the [developers](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) first in case if you want to implement other robot brands. We are happy to contribute to and support this development.

## Cite Robot Components
Robot Components is a free-to-use Grasshopper plugin and does not legally bind you to cite it. However, we have invested time and effort in creating Robot Components, and we would appreciate it if you would cite if you used it. Please use our [DOI from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5773814). To cite all versions of Robot Components in publications use:

```

Robot Components: Intuitive Robot Programming for ABB Robots inside of Rhinoceros Grasshopper.
Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5773814
```
Note that there are two reasons for citing the software used. One is giving recognition to the work done by others which we already addressed. The other is giving details on the system used so that experiments can be replicated. For this, you should cite the version of Robot Components that is used. On our [Zenodo page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5773814) you can find how to cite specific versions. See [How to cite and describe software](https://software.ac.uk/how-cite-software) for more details and an in-depth discussion.

## Version numbering
Robot Components uses the following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme: 

```
0.x.x ---> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
x.0.x ---> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner
x.x.0 ---> PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes
```
Versions that were not released on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/robot-components) are marked as pre-release.
